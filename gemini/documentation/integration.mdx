# Gemini Documentation
    
The **Gemini API** allows developers to integrate AI-powered functionalities into their applications. This documentation provides an overview of the API features, authentication, and response handling.

## Features

- **AI-powered insights**: Get intelligent responses based on natural language queries.
- **Scalability**: Designed to handle high-volume requests efficiently.
- **Security**: Ensures data integrity with authentication mechanisms.

## Authentication

To access the API, authentication is required. Ensure that you have a valid API key before making requests.

### Authentication Methods

- **API Key**: A unique key that identifies your application.
- **OAuth 2.0**: For more secure authentication and user-based access control.

## Request Format

All requests must be structured properly to receive accurate responses.

## Response Structure

Responses are typically structured in JSON format, including:

- **Status Codes**: Indicating success or failure.
- **Response Data**: The actual content returned.
- **Error Messages**: Details in case of failed requests.

## Rate Limits

To ensure fair usage, rate limits are applied. Exceeding the limit may result in temporary restrictions.

> **Tip:** Use pagination for handling large datasets efficiently.

## Error Handling

The API follows standard error-handling practices, providing meaningful error messages to guide developers in troubleshooting issues.

### Common Error Codes

- **400**: Bad request - Invalid input parameters.
- **401**: Unauthorized - Invalid or missing authentication.
- **403**: Forbidden - Access denied.
- **500**: Internal server error - Unexpected failure.

## Best Practices

- **Optimize Requests**: Use efficient queries to improve response time.
- **Handle Errors Gracefully**: Implement retries and error-handling logic.
- **Secure API Keys**: Never expose API keys in public repositories.

## Support
