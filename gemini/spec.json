    "documentation": "# Gemini Documentation\n    \nThe **Gemini API** allows developers to integrate AI-powered functionalities into their applications. This documentation provides an overview of the API features, authentication, and response handling.\n\n## Features\n\n- **AI-powered insights**: Get intelligent responses based on natural language queries.\n- **Scalability**: Designed to handle high-volume requests efficiently.\n- **Security**: Ensures data integrity with authentication mechanisms.\n\n## Authentication\n\nTo access the API, authentication is required. Ensure that you have a valid API key before making requests.\n\n### Authentication Methods\n\n- **API Key**: A unique key that identifies your application.\n- **OAuth 2.0**: For more secure authentication and user-based access control.\n\n## Request Format\n\nAll requests must be structured properly to receive accurate responses.\n\n## Response Structure\n\nResponses are typically structured in JSON format, including:\n\n- **Status Codes**: Indicating success or failure.\n- **Response Data**: The actual content returned.\n- **Error Messages**: Details in case of failed requests.\n\n## Rate Limits\n\nTo ensure fair usage, rate limits are applied. Exceeding the limit may result in temporary restrictions.\n\n> **Tip:** Use pagination for handling large datasets efficiently.\n\n## Error Handling\n\nThe API follows standard error-handling practices, providing meaningful error messages to guide developers in troubleshooting issues.\n\n### Common Error Codes\n\n- **400**: Bad request - Invalid input parameters.\n- **401**: Unauthorized - Invalid or missing authentication.\n- **403**: Forbidden - Access denied.\n- **500**: Internal server error - Unexpected failure.\n\n## Best Practices\n\n- **Optimize Requests**: Use efficient queries to improve response time.\n- **Handle Errors Gracefully**: Implement retries and error-handling logic.\n- **Secure API Keys**: Never expose API keys in public repositories.\n\n## Support\n\nFor further assistance, visit the [support page](#) or contact the API team.\n\nFor production use, always monitor API performance and usage.\n\n---\n\nThis documentation provides an overview of the Gemini API's capabilities. Refer to detailed sections for in-depth guidance on implementation.",
