## Nanonets Authentication

### Requirements
To use the Nanonets, you need:

- A Nanonets account.
- An API Key from Nanonets (available in your account settings).

### Supported Authentication Methods
**Basic Authentication**

### Authentication
Set up Nanonets authentication using your API Key to authenticate and access the API.

#### Obtaining API Key
1. Sign up or log in to <a href="https://app.nanonets.com/">Nanonets</a>.
2. Navigate to the API dashboard.
3. Copy your API Key from the settings page.

### Handling Authentication Errors
If authentication fails, the API will return a **401 Unauthorized** response. Ensure that:

- The API Key is correct.
- The API Key is Base64 encoded properly.
- The request includes the `Authorization` header.

### Security Best Practices
- Keep your API Key secure; do not expose it in public repositories.
- Rotate API Keys periodically.
- Use environment variables to store API Keys instead of hardcoding them.
