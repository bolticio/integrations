# Facebook Posts API

This guide explains how to create, publish, update, and reply to a post on your Facebook Page as the Page, and delete a post using the Pages API from Meta.

## **Before you start**

This guide assumes you have read the Overview.

For a person who can perform tasks on the Page, you will need to implement Facebook Login to ask for the following permissions and receive a Page access token:

- `pages_manage_engagement`
- `pages_manage_posts`
- `pages_read_engagement`
- `pages_read_user_engagement`
- `publish_video` permission, if you are publishing a video to the Page.

Your app user must be able to perform the `CREATE_CONTENT`, `MANAGE`, and `MODERATE` tasks on the Page in the API requests.

### If your app users do not own or manage the Page

If the API requests are not initiated by Page owners or managers, your app will need a **User access token** with the following features:

- **Page Public Content Access**

---

When testing an API call, you can include the `access_token` parameter set to your access token. However, for secure calls from your app, always use the **Access Token class**.

---

## **Publish posts**

To publish a post to a Page, send a `POST` request to the `/me/feed` endpoint, where `page_id` is the ID of your Page, with the following parameters:

- `message`: The text for your post.
- `link`: Your URL, if you want to post a link.
- `published`: Set to `true` to publish the post immediately (default) or `false` to publish later.
- Include `scheduled_publish_time` (if `published` is set to `false`) with the date in one of the following formats:
  - An integer **UNIX timestamp** (e.g., `1530432000`).
  - An **ISO 8061 timestamp string** (e.g., `2018-09-01T10:15:30+01:00`).
  - Any string parsable by PHP's `strtotime()` (e.g., `+2 weeks`, `tomorrow`).

### Notes about scheduled posts

- The publish date must be between **10 minutes** and **30 days** from the time of the API request.
- If relying on `strtotime()`'s relative date strings, you can **read-after-write** the `scheduled_publish_time` of the created post to verify it.

### **Example Request**

Formatted for readability. Replace `page_id` and other placeholders like `your_message_text` with your actual values.

### **Example Response**

On success, your app receives the following JSON response with the ID of the post:

```json
{
  "id": "page_post_id"
}
```

---

## **Add audience targeting**

To limit who can see a Page post, you can add the `targeting.geo_locations` object or the `feed_targeting.geo_locations` parameter in your POST request.

```json
{
  "targeting": {
    "geo_locations": {
      "countries": ["CA"],
      "cities": [
        {
          "key": "296875",
          "name": "Toronto"
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### **Troubleshooting**

In some cases, using both a country and a region within that country will result in the following error:

> "Some of your locations overlap. Try removing a location."

In these cases, target either the **region** or the **country**, depending on the coverage you need.

---

## **Publish Media Posts**

You can publish photos and videos to a Page.

### Publish a photo

To publish a photo to a Page, send a `POST` request to the `/page_id/photos` endpoint, where `page_id` is the ID of your Page, with the `url` parameter set to the photo URL.

### **Example Request**

### **Example Response**

On success, your app receives the following JSON response with the ID of the photo and the post:

```json
{
  "id": "photo_id",
  "post_id": "page_post_id"
}
```

### Publish a video

Please visit the [Video API documentation](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/video-api/) to publish a video post to your Page.

---

## **Get Posts**

To get a list of Page posts, send a `GET` request to the `/me/feed` endpoint.

### **Example Request**

### **Example Response**

On success, your app receives the following JSON response, which includes an array of objects with details of each post on your Page:

```json
{
  "data": [
    {
      "created_time": "2019-01-02T18:31:28+0000",
      "message": "This is my test post on my Page.",
      "id": "page_post_id"
    }
  ]
}
```
# Limitations

### Live Videos
If a Page post contains a video that has expired, such as a live broadcast, you can get some post fields but not fields related to the video. The video has its own privacy rules. If the video has expired, you must be the Page admin to view its information.

### Message CTA
Any access token can be used to request publicly shared Page posts as long as your app has been approved for the **Page Public Content Access Feature**. However, posts with message CTAs cannot be accessed using another Page's access token since pages cannot message other pages.

### Page Post URLs
The URL, or permalink, for a Page post is:

`https://www.facebook.com/page_post_id`

---

## Update a Post

To update a Page post, send a `POST` request to the `/page_post_id` endpoint with the parameters you want to update set to the new content.

### Example Request
Formatted for readability. Replace **italicized values**, such as `page_post_id`, with your values.

### Successful Response
On success, your app receives the following JSON response with `success` set to `true`:

```json
{
  "success": true
}
```

### Limitations
An app can only update a Page post if the post was made using that app.

---

## Delete a Post

To delete a Page post, send a `DELETE` request to the `/page_post_id` endpoint where `page_post_id` is the ID of the post you want to delete.

### Example Request
Formatted for readability. Replace **italicized values**, such as `page_post_id`, with your values.

### Successful Response
On success, your app receives the following JSON response with `success` set to `true`:

```json
{
  "success": true
}
```
