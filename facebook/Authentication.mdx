Obtain a User Access Token using Facebook Login.\n2. Query the `/me/accounts` endpoint to retrieve:\n   - Page ID.\n   - Page Access Token.\n3. Use the retrieved ID and token to interact with the Page node.\n\n- If multiple Pages are granted:\n  - Capture all Page IDs and tokens.\n  - Provide app Users with options to target specific Pages.\n",
