However, for secure calls from your app, always use the **Access Token class**.\n\n---\n\n## **Publish posts**\n\nTo publish a post to a Page, send a `POST` request to the `/me/feed` endpoint, where `page_id` is the ID of your Page, with the following parameters:\n\n- `message`: The text for your post.\n- `link`: Your URL, if you want to post a link.\n- `published`: Set to `true` to publish the post immediately (default) or `false` to publish later.\n- Include `scheduled_publish_time` (if `published` is set to `false`) with the date in one of the following formats:\n  - An integer **UNIX timestamp** (e.g., `1530432000`).\n  - An **ISO 8061 timestamp string** (e.g., `2018-09-01T10:15:30+01:00`).\n  - Any string parsable by PHP's `strtotime()` (e.g., `+2 weeks`, `tomorrow`).\n\n### Notes about scheduled posts\n\n- The publish date must be between **10 minutes** and **30 days** from the time of the API request.\n- If relying on `strtotime()`'s relative date strings, you can **read-after-write** the `scheduled_publish_time` of the created post to verify it.\n\n---\n\n### **Example Request**\n\nFormatted for readability. Replace `page_id` and other placeholders like `your_message_text` with your actual values.\n\n### **Example Response**\n\nOn success, your app receives the following JSON response with the ID of the post:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"id\": \"page_post_id\"\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## **Add audience targeting**\n\nTo limit who can see a Page post, you can add the `targeting.geo_locations` object or the `feed_targeting.geo_locations` parameter in your POST request.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"targeting\": {\n    \"geo_locations\": {\n      \"countries\": [\"CA\"],\n      \"cities\": [\n        {\n          \"key\": \"296875\",\n          \"name\": \"Toronto\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### **Troubleshooting**\n\nIn some cases, using both a country and a region within that country will result in the following error:\n\n> \"Some of your locations overlap. Try removing a location.\"\n\nIn these cases, target either the **region** or the **country**, depending on the coverage you need.\n\n---\n\n## **Publish Media Posts**\n\nYou can publish photos and videos to a Page.\n\n### Publish a photo\n\nTo publish a photo to a Page, send a `POST` request to the `/page_id/photos` endpoint, where `page_id` is the ID of your Page, with the `url` parameter set to the photo URL.\n\n### **Example Request**\n\n### **Example Response**\n\nOn success, your app receives the following JSON response with the ID of the photo and the post:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"id\": \"photo_id\",\n  \"post_id\": \"page_post_id\"\n}\n```\n\n### Publish a video\n\nPlease visit the [Video API documentation](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/video-api/) to publish a video post to your Page.\n\n---\n\n## **Get Posts**\n\nTo get a list of Page posts, send a `GET` request to the `/me/feed` endpoint.\n\n### **Example Request**\n\n### **Example Response**\n\nOn success, your app receives the following JSON response, which includes an array of objects with details of each post on your Page:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"data\": [\n    {\n      \"created_time\": \"2019-01-02T18:31:28+0000\",\n      \"message\": \"This is my test post on my Page.\",\n      \"id\": \"page_post_id\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n# Limitations\n\n### Live Videos\nIf a Page post contains a video that has expired, such as a live broadcast, you can get some post fields but not fields related to the video. The video has its own privacy rules. If the video has expired, you must be the Page admin to view its information.\n\n### Message CTA\nAny access token can be used to request publicly shared Page posts as long as your app has been approved for the **Page Public Content Access Feature**. However, posts with message CTAs cannot be accessed using another Page's access token since pages cannot message other pages.\n\n### Page Post URLs\nThe URL, or permalink, for a Page post is:\n\n`https://www.facebook.com/page_post_id`\n\n---\n\n## Update a Post\n\nTo update a Page post, send a `POST` request to the `/page_post_id` endpoint with the parameters you want to update set to the new content.\n\n### Example Request\nFormatted for readability. Replace **italicized values**, such as `page_post_id`, with your values.\n\n### Successful Response\nOn success, your app receives the following JSON response with `success` set to `true`:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"success\": true\n}\n```\n\n### Limitations\nAn app can only update a Page post if the post was made using that app.\n\n---\n\n## Delete a Post\n\nTo delete a Page post, send a `DELETE` request to the `/page_post_id` endpoint where `page_post_id` is the ID of the post you want to delete.\n\n### Example Request\nFormatted for readability. Replace **italicized values**, such as `page_post_id`, with your values.\n\n### Successful Response\nOn success, your app receives the following JSON response with `success` set to `true`:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"success\": true\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## Next Steps\n\n- Learn how to comment on Page posts and **@mention** a specific person or Page who posted or commented on your Page.\n\n---\n\n## See Also\n\n- [Video API guides](#)\n- [Video Uploads Guide](#)\n- [Video API Guide](#)\n\n---\n\n## References\n\n- [Page Reference](#)\n- [Page Feed Reference](#)\n- [Page Post Reference](#)\n- [Permissions Reference](#)\n- [Photo Reference](#)\n- [Page Tasks](#)\n- [Video Reference](#)",
