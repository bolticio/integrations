# Anthropic Documentation

Integrate your workflow with the **Anthropic** to leverage powerful AI capabilities powered by Claude. This documentation provides an overview of the integration, key operations, and setup instructions.

---

## Introduction

The Anthropic API enables seamless interaction with Claude, allowing you to build advanced AI-powered features such as conversational AI, content generation, and more.  

This document covers essential details for integration, including supported operations and example usage.

---

## Prerequisites

To use the Anthropic API, you need:
- An Anthropic Console account.
- An API key for secure authentication.
- Python 3.7+ or TypeScript 4.5+ (if using the SDKs).  

For detailed setup instructions, refer to the <a href = "https://docs.anthropic.com" target = "_blank"> Anthropic API documentation </a>.

## Supported Operations

### Messages API

The Messages API allows you to interact with Claude to generate responses, complete prompts, or create conversations. It supports both single-turn and multi-turn interactions.

**Key Features:**
- **Text Input and Output**: Send prompts and receive generated responses.
- **Image Input**: Use images (in base64 format) for multimodal interactions.
- **System Prompts**: Define the tone, personality, or behavior of Claude.

---

### Example Operations

1. **Create a Message**  
   Generate the next message in a conversation based on the provided input messages.

   - **Endpoint:** `/v1/messages`  
   - **Method:** POST  
   - **Headers:**  
     - `x-api-key`: Your unique API key.  
     - `Accept`: `application/json`  
     - `Content-Type`: `application/json`  
   - **Body Parameters:**  
     - `model`: The model to use for the response (e.g., `claude-3-5`).  
     - `messages`: An array of input messages, alternating between `user` and `assistant` roles.  
     - `system`: A system-level prompt to guide Claude’s behavior (optional).  
     - `temperature`: Controls randomness in responses (default: `1.0`).  
     - `max_tokens`: The maximum number of tokens to generate.  

---

## Response Structure

The response from the Anthropic API includes the following fields:

- **`id`**: Unique identifier for the request.  
- **`type`**: Object type (e.g., `message`).  
- **`content`**: The generated response content (text or other formats).  
- **`stop_reason`**: Why the generation stopped (e.g., `end_turn`, `max_tokens`).  
- **`usage`**: Token counts for the request and response.  

---

## System Prompts

System prompts allow you to define the behavior, tone, or goals for Claude. For example:

- **Example Prompt:**
  ```json
  "system": "You are a helpful and concise assistant."
  ```

- **Creative Prompt:**
  ```json
  "system": "You are a world-class poet. Respond only with short poems."
  ```

System prompts can be used to:
- Adjust Claude's personality (e.g., formal, casual, poetic).
- Restrict responses to specific formats (e.g., bullet points, summaries).

---

## Error Handling

If the API call fails, an error message is returned in the following structure:

- **Error Response Fields:**
  - `message`: Details of the error.
  - `code`: HTTP status code.

- **Common Error Codes:**
  - `401 Unauthorized`: Invalid or missing API key.
  - `429 Too Many Requests`: Rate limit exceeded.
  - `500 Internal Server Error`: Server issue.

---

## Next Steps

1. Set up your API key in your development environment.
2. Explore the Messages API to create custom workflows.
3. Experiment with system prompts to fine-tune Claude’s behavior.  
4. Refer to the <a href = "https://docs.anthropic.com" target = "_blank"> Anthropic API documentation </a> for more advanced use cases.
