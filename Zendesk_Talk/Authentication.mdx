## Access Token/API Token

To use the Zendesk Talk node, you need to authenticate using an API Token. Follow the steps below to set up your API Token credentials and authorize access to your Zendesk Talk voice data.

### Steps:

#### Connect via Boltic
Enter the **API Token**, **Email Address**, and **Subdomain** of your Zendesk account in the required fields.

#### Generate API Token
1. **Sign in to Zendesk**
   - Go to your Zendesk instance at `https://{subdomain}.zendesk.com` and sign in with your account credentials

2. **Navigate to Admin Center**
   - Click on the gear icon or "Admin" in the left sidebar
   - Select "Admin Center" from the menu options

3. **Access API Settings**
   - In Admin Center, click on "Apps and integrations" in the sidebar
   - Under the "APIs" section, select "API tokens"

4. **Enable Token Access**
   - In the API settings page, locate the "API configuration" section
   - Click on the "Allow API token access" setting to **Enabled**
   - This allows API token authentication for your account

5. **Generate Your API Token**
   - Click the "Add API token" button
   - Enter an optional description for the token (e.g., "Boltic Integration")
   - Click "Save" to generate the token

7. **Gather Required Information**
   - **API Token**: The token you just generated
   - **Email Address**: Your Zendesk login email address
   - **Subdomain**: Your Zendesk subdomain (from your URL)

8. **Test Your Connection**
   - Use the API Token with your email and subdomain in your Boltic integration

### Important Notes:
- **Token Security**: Keep your API Token secure and never share it publicly
- **Token Management**: You can generate multiple tokens and deactivate them as needed from the Admin Center
- **Rate Limits**: Talk API has specific rate limits (15,000 requests per 5 minutes for general endpoints)
- **Trial Limitations**: Some endpoints have restricted functionality on trial accounts

Once you have your API Token, email address, and subdomain, paste them into the Boltic Zendesk Talk node configuration, and you'll be ready to automate your voice communication workflows!
