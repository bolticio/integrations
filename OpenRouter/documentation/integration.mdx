# OpenRouter

The OpenRouter connector enables your workflows to send and receive messages from multiple large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4, Claude, Mistral, and more. This guide will help you configure the connector and perform AI-powered operations like chat completions and image analysis.

## Getting Started

Before using the OpenRouter connector, you'll need to complete a few setup steps.

### **Prerequisites**

- **OpenRouter Account**: You must have an OpenRouter account. Sign up at [openrouter.ai](https://openrouter.ai/) if you haven't already.  
- **OpenRouter API Key**: Obtain a valid API key from your [OpenRouter Dashboard](https://openrouter.ai/settings).
> ⚠️ **Note:** Ensure that the selected models are supported and accessible under your OpenRouter account.  

### Supported Authentication Methods

- **API Key Authentication**: Use your OpenRouter API key for simple and straightforward authentication.

## Basic Operations

Here are some of the basic operations you can perform with the Mailchimp connector:

### Chat Completion

- **Send Chat Message**: Send a message to a selected model and receive an AI-generated response.
- **Send Multi Chat Message**: Submit a structured chat history to simulate a multi-turn conversation with the model.

### Image Analysis

- **Send Image for Analysis**: Submit an image to a multimodal model for visual understanding or insight extraction.

### Generation Tracking

- **Fetch Generation Details**: Retrieve metadata or result history of a specific generation using its ID for auditing or reference.

### Models

- **Get models** – Get a list of all models.

## Completion Parameters

You can optionally include additional settings to control model behavior:

- `temperature`: Controls randomness (default `1.0`)
- `max_tokens`: Limits the response length
- `top_p`: Controls nucleus sampling

## Conclusion

The OpenRouter connector offers flexible access to powerful LLMs, enabling you to build AI-enhanced applications, chatbots, visual analysis pipelines, and content tools. With easy configuration and rich capabilities, it's ideal for any intelligent workflow.
