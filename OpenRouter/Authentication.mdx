# **OpenRouter API Authentication**

Guide on authenticating API requests for the OpenRouter AI API.

This document provides a comprehensive guide on how to authenticate API requests for the OpenRouter API. The system uses **API Keys** to ensure secure communication with OpenRouter’s model routing platform.

---

## **Authentication Types**

OpenRouter API supports the following authentication type:

-   **API Key**: A secure token that identifies and authorizes your application to access OpenRouter’s supported language models.

---

### **Obtaining Your API Key**

1. Log in to the <a href="https://openrouter.ai/settings" target="_blank">OpenRouter Dashboard</a>.
2. Scroll to the **API Key** section.
3. Click **"Create Key"** to generate a new key, or copy an existing one.
4. Store this key securely. It starts with `sk-or-`.

---

## **Validation**

To validate the key, make a test request to the endpoint using **Test & Save** button.
A successful response confirms your key is valid and active.

---

## **Troubleshooting**

If authentication fails:

-   Ensure your **API Key** is copied correctly.
-   Confirm the key begins with `sk-or-`.
-   Check that the key has not been **revoked** or **expired**.
