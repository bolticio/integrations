    "documentation": "# OpenRouter\n\nThe OpenRouter connector enables your workflows to send and receive messages from multiple large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4, Claude, Mistral, and more. This guide will help you configure the connector and perform AI-powered operations like chat completions and image analysis.\n\n## Getting Started\n\nBefore using the OpenRouter connector, you'll need to complete a few setup steps.\n\n### **Prerequisites**\n\n- **OpenRouter Account**: You must have an OpenRouter account. Sign up at [openrouter.ai](https://openrouter.ai/) if you haven't already.  \n- **OpenRouter API Key**: Obtain a valid API key from your [OpenRouter Dashboard](https://openrouter.ai/settings).\n> ⚠️ **Note:** Ensure that the selected models are supported and accessible under your OpenRouter account.  \n\n### Supported Authentication Methods\n\n- **API Key Authentication**: Use your OpenRouter API key for simple and straightforward authentication.\n\n## Basic Operations\n\nHere are some of the basic operations you can perform with the Mailchimp connector:\n\n### Chat Completion\n\n- **Send Chat Message**: Send a message to a selected model and receive an AI-generated response.\n- **Send Multi Chat Message**: Submit a structured chat history to simulate a multi-turn conversation with the model.\n\n### Image Analysis\n\n- **Send Image for Analysis**: Submit an image to a multimodal model for visual understanding or insight extraction.\n\n### Generation Tracking\n\n- **Fetch Generation Details**: Retrieve metadata or result history of a specific generation using its ID for auditing or reference.\n\n### Models\n\n- **Get models** – Get a list of all models.\n\n## Completion Parameters\n\nYou can optionally include additional settings to control model behavior:\n\n- `temperature`: Controls randomness (default `1.0`)\n- `max_tokens`: Limits the response length\n- `top_p`: Controls nucleus sampling\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe OpenRouter connector offers flexible access to powerful LLMs, enabling you to build AI-enhanced applications, chatbots, visual analysis pipelines, and content tools. With easy configuration and rich capabilities, it's ideal for any intelligent workflow.\n\nFor more detailed information on the OpenRouter API and its specifications, refer to the [OpenRouter API Documentation](https://openrouter.ai/docs).",
