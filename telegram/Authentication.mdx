# Telegram Bot Authentication

This guide walks you through setting up Telegram Bot API authentication within the Boltic platform.

## Prerequisites

-   A **Telegram Bot Token**.

## Setting Up Telegram Bot Authentication in Boltic

1. **Create a Telegram Bot**

    - Open the **Telegram app** on your device.
    - Search for the **BotFather** bot (official Telegram bot creation tool).
    - Start a chat with BotFather and use the command `/newbot` to create a new bot.
    - Follow the prompts to choose a name and username for your bot.
    - Once the bot is created, BotFather will provide you with a **Bot Token**. Copy this token, as you'll need it in the next steps.

2. **Log In to Your Boltic Account**

    - Log into your Boltic account or navigate to the Boltic Open Source dashboard.

3. **Navigate to Integrations from the Primary Menu**

    - Click on `Sources` and then click on `+ Add New source`.

4. **Select Source Type**

    - On the **Set up the source** page, search for `Telegram` in the search bar and select it.

5. **Configure Integration**

    - **Name:** Enter a name for the Telegram bot integration (e.g., "Telegram Bot Integration").
    - **Authentication type:** Select **Bot Token** as the authentication method.
    - **Bot Token:** Paste the **Bot Token** you received from BotFather into this field.

6. **Details (Optional)**

    - **Tags:** Add any tags for categorization (e.g., `telegram`, `bot`).
    - **Description:** Optionally, provide a brief description of the integration (e.g., "Telegram bot for receiving user messages").

7. **Test and Save Integration**

    - Click **Test Connection** to ensure the provided details are correct and the connection to Telegram is successful.
    - Once the connection test is successful, click **Set up source** to complete the configuration.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues during setup:

-   **Invalid Bot Token:** Ensure the token provided by BotFather is correct and has no extra spaces or characters.
-   **Network Issues:** Check your internet connection to ensure there are no network issues blocking access to Telegram's servers.
-   **Bot Permissions:** Ensure your bot has the necessary permissions to interact with Telegram APIs.
