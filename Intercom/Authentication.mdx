# Intercom

## Overview

The Intercom node allows you to connect your application with Intercom to automate tasks such as managing contacts, conversations, companies, tags, and more. It helps streamline customer communication workflows by enabling seamless integration with your Intercom workspace data.

## Authentication Ways

**Access Token** <a href="https://developers.intercom.com/docs/build-an-integration/learn-more/authentication" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Documentation</a>

## Access Token/API Token

To use the Intercom node, you need to authenticate using an Access Token. Follow the steps below to set up your Access Token credentials and authorize access to your Intercom workspace data.

### Steps:

#### Connect via Boltic

Enter the **Access Token** of your Intercom app in the required field.

#### Generate Access Token

1. **Sign in to Intercom**
   - Go to <a href="https://developers.intercom.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Intercom Developer Hub</a> and sign in with your Intercom account

2. **Create a New App**
   - Click on "Your apps" in the top navigation
   - Click "New app" button
   - Choose "Private app" (for accessing your own workspace data)

3. **Configure Your App**
   - Enter an **App name** (e.g., "Boltic Integration")
   - Select your **Intercom workspace** from the dropdown
   - Choose your workspace region (US, EU, or Australia)
   - Click "Create app"

4. **Get Your Access Token**
   - Once your app is created, you'll be redirected to the app details page
   - In the "Authentication" section, you'll see your **Access Token**
   - Copy this token - it will look like: `dG9rOvI0NmJl...`

5. **Configure Permissions (Optional)**
   - By default, your private app has full access to your workspace
   - You can review and modify permissions in the "Authentication" tab if needed

6. **Test Your Connection**
   - Use the Access Token in your Boltic integration
   - The token provides immediate access without requiring OAuth flow
   - Your app will appear as "installed" in your workspace automatically

### Important Notes:

- **Private App**: This integration uses a private app approach, meaning it only accesses your own Intercom workspace data
- **No Review Required**: Private apps don't need Intercom's approval and can be used immediately
- **Token Security**: Keep your Access Token secure and never share it publicly
- **Token Regeneration**: You can regenerate your token anytime from the Developer Hub if compromised
- **Regional Endpoints**: Ensure your API calls go to the correct regional endpoint based on your workspace location


Once you have your Access Token, paste it into the Boltic Intercom node configuration, and you'll be ready to automate your customer communication workflows!
