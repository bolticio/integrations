# Share on LinkedIn

## Overview
LinkedIn is a powerful platform to share content with your social network. Ensure your content receives the professional audience it deserves using Share on LinkedIn.

Use Share on LinkedIn to:
- Get your content in front of an audience of millions of professionals.
- Drive traffic to your site and grow your member base.
- Benefit from having your content shared across multiple professional networks worldwide.

## Getting Started

### Authenticating Members
New members sharing on LinkedIn from your application for the first time will need to follow the **Authenticating with OAuth 2.0 Guide**. When requesting an authorization code in Step 2 of the OAuth 2.0 Guide, make sure to request the `w_member_social` scope!

#### Permission Name and Description:
- **w_member_social**: Required to create a LinkedIn post on behalf of the authenticated member.

#### Steps to Authenticate:
1. **Follow the OAuth 2.0 Guide**: Use the steps in the **Authenticating with OAuth 2.0 Guide** to authenticate users.
2. **Request the Authorization Code**: During Step 2, ensure that you request the `w_member_social` scope along with other necessary parameters.
3. **Receive Access Token**: After successful authentication, you will receive an access token that can be used for sharing content.

If your application does not have this permission, you can add it through the Developer Portal:
1. Go to **My Apps** and select your app.
2. Navigate to the **Products** tab.
3. Add the **Share on LinkedIn** product, which will grant you the `w_member_social` permission.
