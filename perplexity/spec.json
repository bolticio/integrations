This documentation outlines the integration process, key features, and supported operations.\n\n---\n\n## Introduction\n\nThe Perplexity AI enables seamless communication with Sonar, empowering you to build AI-driven features such as conversational AI and more.\n\nThis guide provides essential integration details, including supported operations and usage examples.\n\n---\n\n## Prerequisites\n\nBefore using the Perplexity AI, ensure you have:\n\n- A Perplexity AI Console account.\n- An API key for secure authentication.\n- Python 3.7+ or TypeScript 4.5+ (if using the SDKs).\n- For step-by-step setup instructions, refer to the Perplexity AI documentation.\n\n---\n\n## Supported Authentication Methods\n\n- **API Key**\n\n---\n\n## Basic Operations\n\n- **Chat Completion:** Generate responses powered by Sonar's AI capabilities.\n\nThe Chat Completion operation allows interaction with Sonar to:\n\n- Generate AI responses.\n- Complete prompts with appropriate responses.\n- Facilitate single-turn or multi-turn conversations.\n- While configuring the integration please ensure that \n\n---\n\n## Key Features\n\n- **Models Support:** Use any of (sonar-reasoning-pro, sonar-reasoning, sonar-pro, sonar) models to achieve desired output with optimal costs.\n- **Text Input and Output:** Submit prompts either as (user, assistant, system) to receive AI-generated responses and control the model's behaviour.\n- **Temperature Control:** Adjust the creativity level of Sonar's responses.\n- **Token Limitation:** Limit the output tokens generated by the model to save costs.\n- **Conversation Continuation:** Generate the next message in a conversation based on input messages.",
